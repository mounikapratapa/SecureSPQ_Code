LSH results are computed on plaintext data for the sake of simplicity. In case of encryption, the hashcode indexes directly point to the encrypted vectors. Code will be updated soon. 

The dataset used in this code is randomly generated to test the code for robustness. However, this code works for any kind of SNP data. Just modify the file reads.
