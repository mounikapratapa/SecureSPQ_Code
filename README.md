# Similar-Patient-Query
Use the qr-keygen to generate the required primes. These primes enable us to evaluate the sign function appropriately. Encrypt your hospital database records using the paper's OU encryption scheme and algorithm 1. Use spq_user to perform secure Euclidean distance computation and secure function evaluation. The file hosp_dec file will help you decrypt and evaluate similarity securely without displaying the results.
LSH results are computed on plaintext data for the sake of simplicity. In encryption, the hashcode indexes directly point to the encrypted vectors. Since HE offers 100 % accuracy, it is expected to behave similarly. 

The dataset used in this code is randomly generated to test the code for robustness. However, this code works for any SNP data. Just modify the file reads.
